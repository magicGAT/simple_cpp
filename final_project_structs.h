// POSSIBLE STRUCTS
// ideas: make an entry an array of structs, then the user can determine how many activities
// and expenditures they will include per journal entry. They we will need "header" like object
// which contains the file name

// Possible key table to store filenames in a system similar to the database design outline in 
// adv programming and algo class
